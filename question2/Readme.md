#Question2
This question contains two parts
* Time limited link: to solve this part I added start date, response route and expiration date in the link and hash of them with a salt for security reasons and every time I compare current date to start date and end date
* Count limited link : to solve this part I added a record of request to database in order to keep count of the accesses to the link and also added a salt in created link for security reasons
